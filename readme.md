```

Code, Runtime, Libraries, System tools
```

## Containers?

-  Running instances of images
-  Can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI
-  Can be connected to one or more networks, including the internet
-  Can be connected to one or more storage volumes

## Volumes

-  Data storage mechanism
-  Can be shared among containers
-  Can be reused among containers
-  Can be backed up and restored
-  Can be migrated from one host to another

## Docker Workflow

1. Docker Client

```

2. Docker Host (Docker Daemon)

```

3. Docker Registry (Docker Hub)
